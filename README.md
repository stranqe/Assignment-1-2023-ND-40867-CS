Research Methods:
These are the specific procedures, techniques, tools, and strategies used by researchers to gather, organize, and analyze data. Research methods are the practical, hands-on part of a research process, and they can be qualitative or quantitative.

Qualitative methods: These involve non-numeric data and often include interviews, focus groups, document analysis, and observation. The aim is to understand human behavior and the reasons that govern such behavior.

Quantitative methods: These involve numeric data, often using tools like surveys, experiments, questionnaires, and statistical analysis. The goal here is to quantify variables and generalize results from a sample to the population of interest.

Research Methodology:
Research methodology refers to the overarching theory and analysis of how research is done or the conceptual framework within which the research is conducted. It includes the understanding and the philosophical approach that underlies the chosen methods. Methodology involves the logic behind the methods we choose and involves the study of the methods themselves - including the limitations, reliability, and validity of each.

A methodology provides a blueprint for the research methods, it guides the researcher in the overall approach to be taken, considering the questions being asked, the theoretical framework, the principles and values underlying the research, and the rationale for the selection and use of particular methods.
